%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% A function to create Roman numerals for harmonic analysis.
%%
%% Syntax: \markup \rN { ...list of symbols... }
%%
%% List symbols in this order (as needed): Roman numeral (or note name),
%% quality, inversion figures from top to bottom, "/" (if a secondary
%% function), Roman numeral (or note name).  Usually, you can skip unnecessary
%% items, though a spacer may be needed in some cases.  Use "" instead of the
%% initial symbol to start with the quality or inversion, for example.  Elements
%% must be separated by whitespace.
%%
%% Notenames are represented by their English LilyPond names.  In addition, you
%% may capitalize the name for a capitalized note name.
%%
%% Preceding a string representing a Roman numeral with English alterations
%% (f, flat, s, sharp, ff, flatflat, ss, x, sharpsharp, natural)
%% will attach accidentals, for example, "fVII" -> flat VII; "sharpvi" -> sharp vi.
%% You may precede inversion numbers with alterations, though "+" is not
%% presently supported.
%%
%% Qualities: use "o" for diminished, "h" for half-diminished, "+" for augmented,
%% and "f" for flat.  Other indications are possible such as combinations of "M"
%% and "m" (M, m, MM7, Mm, mm, Mmm9, etc.); add, add6, etc.
%%
%% To scale all numerals: \override  LyricText #'font-size = #2
%% or \override  TextScript #'font-size = #2
%% To scale individual numerals: \markup \override #'(font-size . 2) \rN { ... }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% THE APPROACH %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% In our approach, a Roman numeral consists of

%% 1. A "base".  OPTIONAL. This may be a Roman numeral (some combination of I, i, V,
%% and v, unenforced); a note name; or some other string.  Roman numerals may be
%% preceded by an accidental, and a note name may be followed by one.

%% 2. a quality indicator.  OPTIONAL.  Eventually, this will simply be something to
%% set as a superscript following the base, whether or not it is actually a
%% indicator of quality.

%% 3. A single inversion number, or more than one, to be set as a column.  OPTIONAL.
%% An initial accidental is supported.  (This will be extended to "anything you want
%% to appear in a column after the quality indicator.")

%% 4. "/" followed by a "secondary base" for indicating tonicization.  OPTIONAL.
%% As with 1. this may a Roman numeral or note name, and may include an accidental.

%% The input syntax is chosen to be friendly to the user rather than the computer.
%% In particular, the user usually need only type the symbols needed when
%% reading the analytical symbol aloud.  This is not perfect: spacers
%% may be necessary for omissions.  Additionally, we try to interpret symbols
%% without requiring extra semantic indicators: i.e., figure out whether a string
%% represents a Roman numeral or a note name without the user adding an extra sign.
%% In the future, indicators might prove necessary to resolve ambiguity: along with
%% a flag to distinguish Roman numeral from note name, braces to enclose inversion
%% figures may be useful.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INPUT FORMATTING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The user's input is available as a list of strings.  Here we convert this
%% list into a nested list which describes the structure of the input.

#(define (split-list symbols splitter-list)
   "Split a list of strings by a splitter which is a member of a list of
potential splitters.  The splitter may be alone or part of a string.
input is split into
@code{(( ...strings up to splitter... ) ( ...strings beginning with splitter... ))}
This function is Used to split notation for secondary chords and to isolate
inversion numbers."
   (let loop ((sym symbols) (result '()))
     (cond
      ((or (null? sym)
           (find (lambda (y) (string-contains (car sym) y)) splitter-list))
       (list (reverse result) sym))
      (else (loop (cdr sym) (cons (car sym) result))))))

#(define numbers '("2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9" "11" "13"))

#(define qualities
   ;; only to allow omission of base when quality is alone
   ;; TODO--combinations of M and m, add, ADD . . .
   '("o" "+" "h"))

      ((= 1 len)
       (if (find (lambda (y) (string= (car arg) y)) qualities)
           (list '() (list (car arg)))
           (list (list (car arg)) '()))) ;; TODO figure out which is given
      ((= 2 len) (list (list (car arg)) (cdr arg))))))

#(define (base-quality-figures symbols)
   ;; given (vii o 4 3) --> ((vii o) (4 3)) --> ((vii) (o) (4 3))
   ;; (4 3) --> (() (4 3)) --> (() () (4 3))

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NOTE NAMES / ACCIDENTALS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Formatting the input into interpretable lists continues here.  We are now
%% concerned with distinguishing Roman numerals from note names, and with representing
%% the presence and position of accidentals.

%% If a string belongs to the list of possible English notenames, we assume that
%% it is a note name.  The note name will be typeset as uppercase or lowercase depending
%% on the capitalization of the input string.

%% If a string is not a note name, we look for an alteration prefix, never a suffix.

%% The procedure parse-string-with-accidental breaks a string into a list representing
%% initial/terminal alterations and what is left.

%% Notenames and names of accidentals are based on English names.  Other
%% languages may be used by adding variables modeled after english-note names and
%% english-alterations, and changing the definitions of note names and alterations to
%% point to these new variables.
